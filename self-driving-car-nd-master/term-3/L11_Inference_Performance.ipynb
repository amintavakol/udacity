    "Why performance (speed) matters: Canâ€™t use cloud computing resources due to latency, have to make real-time predictions using on-device hardware.\n",

    "Semantic segmentation is computationally expensive. \n",

    "Can improve performance by 3-5x using optimisations.\n",

    "\t2. Fuse graph operations: reduces number of ops\n",
    "\t\t3. Each layer has to stores tensors. Only calls kernels once. \n",
    "\t\t4. Saves both memory and time.\n",
    "\t\t5. Typically only fuse during inference because we may want to preserve graph flexibility (add or remove layers) during training.\n",
    "\t\t6. Can do manually by coding a kernel that performs three fused ops together. \n",
