    "## Vehicle Subsystems\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sensors\n",
    "- Hardware components that gather data about the environment\n",
    "- Lidars, radars, cameras, GPS systems, IMU (inertial measurement units), ultrasonic sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Perception\n",
    "- Software to process sensor data (to understand the environment).\n",
    "- e.g. processing videos from a camera to detect other vehicles.\n",
    "- Further division into two subsystems:\n",
    "    - Detection: understanding the surrounding environment\n",
    "        - E.g. Lane detection, traffic sign and traffic light detection and classification, object detection and tracking (using camera, lidar and radar data), free space detection.\n",
    "    - Localisation: using sensor (primarily lidar) and map data to determine the vehicle's precise location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Planning\n",
    "- For behaviour planning, short and long range path planning.\n",
    "- Route planning (high level path of the vehicle between two points on a map)\n",
    "- Prediction: Estimates what actions other objects may take in the future.\n",
    "- Behaviour: What maneuver(s) our vehicle should take.\n",
    "- Trajectory: What trajectory is best for the desired behaviour?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Control\n",
    "- Ensures vehicle follows paths generated by the planning subsytem.\n",
    "- Sends steering commands to the vehicle.\n",
