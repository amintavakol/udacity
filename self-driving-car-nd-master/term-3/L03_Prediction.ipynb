    "\n",
    "- E.g. predicting whether a car will go straight or turn right (to decide whether or not you can turn right now).\n",
    "- Prediction is **multi-modal**: the probability distribution has multiple peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output usually in the form of two trajectories, with a probability for each trajectory.\n",

    "### Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model-based approaches: mathematical models of motions\n",
    "    * e.g. process models\n",
    "    * multi-model estimators -> handling uncertainty about which maneuver ran object will do in a particular situation\n",
    "* Data-driven approaches: machine learning\n",
    "    * e.g.: trajectory clustering\n",
    "* Hybrid approaches: \n",
    "    * intent classification (figure out what a driver wants to do) -> trajectory generation (how a driver is likely to do it)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Fer previous example:\n",
    "* One model forgoing staright, one model forgoing right\n",
    "    * Calculate expected trajectories for each model\n",
    "    * Compare observed behaviour with expected trajectory\n",
    "* Model takes into account physical behaviour of car and constraints imposed by traffic laws etc.\n",
    "    * u\n",
    "    * May miss subtle patterns that may be picked up by data-driven approaches\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "### Purely data-driven approach: Trajectory clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stage 1: Offline Training\n",
    "3-04\n",
    "1. Get a lot of trajectories (e.g. by placing static camera at intersection)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised clustering: car can either turn left, go straight or turn right. -> Expect three unsupervised clusters.\n",
    "    * May expect more than three clusters, e.g. for each action may have one cluster where the car stops in front of a traffic light first (red light) and one where the car doesn't stop (green light)\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Stage 2: Online Prediction\n",
    "* Comparison using similarity measure used to perform clustering\n",
    "    * Update belief for each trajectory based on similarity of observed partial trajectory to prototype trajectory (expected trajectory for each action)\n",
    "    * Compute predicted trajectory for each cluster (e.g. by taking the most similar prototype trajectory)\n",
    "        * Still need to choose one predicted trajectory even if P(trajectory) same for each trajectory -> e.g. randomly choose one traj for now while broadcasting probabilities for all trajectories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based approach: implementation details\n",
    "\n",

    "* Identify common driver behaviours: e.g. (at an intersection)go straight, turn left, turn right\n",

    "    * Fn that can be used to compute the state of an obj at time (t+1) from the state at time t.\n",
    "    * Incorporates some uncertainty.\n",
    "    * Each process model produces a predicted state at time (t+1).\n",
    "* Update beliefs: compare predictions with observations\n",
    "* Trajectory generation: use a multimodal estimation algorithm to derive the p(x) of each maneouver. \n",
    "* Iterate through steps 3-4.\n",

    "Motivation: Representing position on a road in a more intuitive way than Cartesian x,y coordinates.\n",

    "Tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy when choosing process models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lane-following models:\n",
    "1. Linear point model: Assume can move in any direction at any time\n",
    "    * e.g. Car moves forward at every timestep and is assumed to keep a constant distance to the lane center\n",
    "2. Introduce non-linearities (through sines and cosines)\n",
    "3. Take into account a car is a non-holonomic system (state depends on the path taken to achieve the state)\n",
    "    - e.g. use bicycle model (input: steering angle (PID controller) and acceleration (constant v or constant a model, or PID controller with speed limit as the target))\n",
    "    - tend to strike a good balance between simplicity and accuracy\n",
    "4. Even more complexity: dynamic bicycle model\n",
    "    * F_c,f: lateral force on tires at the front of the vehicle\n",
    "    * F_c,f: lateral force on tires at the rear of the vehicle\n",
    "    * Large uncertainty means increased accuracy from using these more complex models usually are not worth the additional compute required.\n",
