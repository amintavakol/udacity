    "### ROS\n",
    "Robot Operating System (open source framework that simplifies robot development. Provides:\n",
    "- Means of talking to hardware without writing your own device drivers\n",
    "- Processes to communicate with each other via message passing\n",
    "- Tools for visualisation, simulation and analysis\n",
    "- Easier deployment and development of software\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common components of a generic robot:\n",
    "- Sensors for perception\n",
    "- Software for making high-level decisions\n",
    "- Motors and controllers for actuation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodes and topics\n",
    "ROS breaks down these processes into many small processes called **nodes**.\n",
    "- e.g. position estimator, wheel encoder, camera, motor control\n",
    "\n",
    "How nodes can communicato with each other:\n",
    "1. Through the ROS master.\n",
    "    - ROS master acts as a:\n",
    "        - Manager of all the nodes.\n",
    "        - Parameter server. Stores parameter and config values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Message-passing over topics (named buses)\n",
    "    - Way for nodes to share data with each other\n",
    "    - Bus: Pipe between nodes through which messages flow\n",
    "    - Node must publish to a topic to send a message to it, or subscribe to a topic to receive a message from it.\n",
    "    - A single node may simultaneously publish and subscribe to many topics.\n",

    "### Message passing\n",
    "- Over 200 different message types (on a ROS distribution) for communicating physical quantities (s, v, a, rotations, t), sensor readings (laser scans, point clouds, inertial measurements), \n",
    "- Can define your own message types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Services\n",
    "- Allow passing of messages between nodes on a one-to-one basis using a request-response pattern.\n",
    "- Not a bus, no publishers or subscribers.\n",
    "- Useful if e.g. a behaviour executor only wants to capture an image from the camera every once in a while.\n",
    "    - Can trigger new sensor measurements\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Compute Graphs\n",

    "Use the tool `rqt_graph` to visualise the compute graph of an ROS system."
