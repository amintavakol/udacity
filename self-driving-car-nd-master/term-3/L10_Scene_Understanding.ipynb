    "*Notes from lessons taught by Kelvin Lwin, Senior Deep Learning Instructor at NVIDIA, for Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Approaches to Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Soln 1: Bounding Boxes \n",
    "- Neural network figures out where object is, and draws a bounding box around it\n",
    "- e.g. YOLO and SSD models\n",
    "    - perform well at high FPS\n",
    "    - But cannot draw a bounding box around curved objects\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution 2: Semantic Segmentation\n",
    "- Pixel-level classification.\n",
    "- In scene understanding, people tend to train multiple decoders:\n",
    "    - Segmentation: classify pixels.\n",
    "    - Depth decoder: predicts how far away the pixel is\n",
    "        - Use info to reconstruct rich 3D scene.\n",
    "        \n",
    "### 2. Metric for Semantic Segmentation: Intersection Over Unions (IOU)\n",
    "- IOU = Intersection set / Union set, <= 1\n",
    "    - Intersection set: AND operation: pixel that is both truly part of that class and classified as part of the class by the network\n",
    "    - Union set: OR operation: pixel that is either truly part of the class or classified as part of the class by the network\n",
    "- Used to measure the performance of a model on a semantic segmentation task.\n",
    "    - Can also consider mean IOU. \n",
    "- Use by calling `tf.metric.mean_iou`."
