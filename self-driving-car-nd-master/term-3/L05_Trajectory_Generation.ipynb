    "#### 2. Potential Field Methods:\n",
    "* Each obstacle creates a sort of anti-gravity field, which makes it hard for the vehicle to come near it.\n",

    "* Use a collision detection module that probes the free space to see if a config is in collision or not\n",
    "* Not all parts of the free space need to be explored to find a solution (vs combinatorial methods or optimal control)\n",
